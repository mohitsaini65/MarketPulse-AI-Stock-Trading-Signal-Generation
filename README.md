# MarketPulse AI – Stock Trading Signal Generation

This project is about using financial news data to generate stock trading signals. 
The main idea is to study how news and market-related features can help in predicting buy or sell signals.

## About the Project

Stock prices are often affected by news and public sentiment.  
In this project, financial news articles are analyzed along with market data to understand their impact on trading decisions.

The notebook contains the complete workflow starting from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

## Dataset

- Financial news dataset related to the Indian stock market  
- Contains news text along with market-related information  
- The dataset is used to create features for predicting trading signals

---

## Approach Used

- Cleaned and preprocessed the news text data  
- Performed exploratory data analysis to understand patterns  
- Created features from news and market information  
- Trained machine learning models to generate trading signals  
- Evaluated the model using standard classification metrics  

---

## Tools and Libraries

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Google Colab  

---

## How to Run

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook  
2. Upload the required dataset file  
3. Run all cells in order  
4. Check the predicted trading signals and evaluation results

## Results

The model is able to learn patterns between financial news and market behavior.  
This project shows how news-based features can be useful for building trading signal systems.
